# SIMTEK Service System
The utility OS (based on arch, btw.) created by me for use on client computers

## Default Login Information
Because the OS is pre-installed, it already has a user account created. 

Default root password: "password"

Default Username: "servicesystem"
Default User Password: "password"

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THESE PASSWORDS
